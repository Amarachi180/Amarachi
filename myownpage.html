   <a><h3 id="step 1">STEP 1 INGREDIENTS :</h3></a>
<P>Lasagna takes a lot of ingredients, but it also feeds a lot of people.</P>

<b>For the tomato meat sauce:</b>
<ul>
<li>2 x 28 oz. cans tomatoes - crushed or whole is best! If you get whole canned tomatoes just crush them in your hands.</li>
<li>1-2 tbsp tomato paste (this is my favorite kind!)</li>
<li>1 large onion</li>
<li>garlic, garlic, garlic - I always use a ton! I'd say two cloves minimum!</li>
<li>1 pound ground beef, preferably lean</li>
<li>1 pound Italian sausage - choose whatever spice level you like!</li>
<li>dried oregano</li>
<li>Italian seasoning</li>
<li>salt and pepper</li>
<li>fresh basil - dried can also be substituted!</li>
<li>olive oil</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that if you can always just cook up some meat and then pour a couple jars of tomato sauce over it, so don't worry about it if you look at the ingredients and wonder what you've gotten yourself into.</p>

<b>For the rest of the lasagna:</b>
<ul>
<li>1 package of noodles (should be around a pound in weight) - oven-ready or regular.</li>
<li>1 lb. mozzarella</li>
<li>1/2 lb. good quality parmesan</li>
<li>1 lb. ricotta cheese</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>dried oregano + basil</li>
</ul>
<b>Hardware:</b>
<ul>
<li>large pan to make the sauce in</li>
<li>13x9 baking dish - I recommend glass</li>
<li>large pot for boiling pasta (if not using oven-ready noodles)</li>
</ul>

<a><h3 id="step 2">STEP 2: MAKING THE MEAT SAUCE, PART ONE</h3></a>

<p>Prep work and browning the meat!</p>

<p>Roughly dice the onion, and mince as much garlic as you want. I used quite a bit as you can see.</p>

<p>Once you've got the veggies prepped, film your sauce pan with olive oil. Heat the pan over medium and cook the ground beef and Italian sausage until browned. If a lot of fat seeps out, drain most of it. You need only a few tablespoons of fat to cook the onion and garlic in.</p>

<p>Once you've drained the extra fat, throw in the onions and garlic.</p>

<p>Stir this around for a few minutes over medium heat until the onions become soft. Then add in a few good pinches of Italian seasoning, a pinch of basil, oregano and salt, and a tablespoon or two of tomato paste.</p>

<a><h3 id="step 3">STEP 3: MAKING THE MEAT SAUCE, PART TWO</h3></a>

<p>Now, open both cans of tomatoes and dump them in. Mix it around for a moment, and bring to a light boil. Watch out for splatters!</p>

<p>Lower the heat to a simmer and cover. Let the sauce simmer for at least a half hour while you do the rest of the prep work.</p>

<h3><a href="#top">Go up!!</a></h3>


<a><h3 id="step 4">STEP 4: COOK (OR DON'T COOK) YOUR NOODLES</h3></a>

<p>At this point, if you're using regular lasagna noodles, you'll need to fill a stock pot with water and cook those. I find it's best to cook them for the shortest time listed on the package or a minute or two under so they don't get soggy while the lasagna bakes.</p>

<p>Once they're done, rinse them with cold water using a colander and set them aside. Try to separate them a bit so they stick less later.</p>

<p>if you're using oven-ready noodles, you can worry about them later.</p>


<a><h3 id="step 5">STEP 5: PREP THE CHEESE AND FINISH THE SAUCE</h3></a>

<p>Over the years, I've started combining all my cheese at the beginning - it makes for easier assembly!</p>

<p>Grab out a couple handfuls of parmesan and mozzarella and put them in a small bowl - this will be for topping the lasagna.</p>

<p>Place the ricotta into a large bowl, along with one egg. Add the rest of the parmesan and mozzarella, as well as a couple good pinches of Italian seasoning and basil. Mix this all together with your hands.</p>

<p>Once you're all done with the cheese, double check the sauce and adjust the flavors as necessary. You may need to add salt, sugar or more herbs - just keep adding and testing until it's good for you!</p>

<p>If you're using fresh basil, chop up a handful and throw it in now. Once the basil is in, stir the sauce well and turn off the heat.</p>
<h3><a href="#top">Go up!</a></h3>


<a><h3 id="step 6">STEP 6: ASSEMBLING!</h3></a>

<p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F / 200 degrees C.</p>

<p>Make sure your cheeses, noodles and sauce are all within easy reach.</p>

<p>Ladle just enough sauce to cover the bottom of the pan. Then place noodles on top of the sauce just to cover, slightly overlapping. (If you're using over-ready noodles, follow the box directions) If they're broken, piece them together as much as possible. Spread 1/3 of the cheese mixture over the noodles.</p>

<p>Now you'll put more sauce over the cheese and then noodles, more cheese, and then sauce again. You repeat the basic build three times.</p>

<p>For the fourth and final level, lay down your cheese mixture and top with the rest of the sauce. Now sprinkle the parmesan and mozzarella you set aside over it.</p>

<p>Now bake at 375 F for 40 minutes - if you're using a metal pan, check after 30 and make sure it's not too dark! If it's starting to get dark on top just pull it out.</p>


<a><h3 id="step 7">STEP 7: FINISHED PRODUCT!</h3></a>

<p>Once it's done baking, pull it out and let it sit for a few minutes before cutting into it! Otherwise it will just be hot lasagna lava.</p>

<p>Serve it to a bunch of hungry friends and/or family with warm garlic bread and enjoy!!!</p>
